    ///   - presencePenalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

Maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the OpenAI Tokenizer窶馬ot English words) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

    ///   - choices: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.
    ///   - stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
    ///   - maxTokens: The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens).
    ///   - presencePenalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
    ///   - frequencyPenalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
    ///   - logitBias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the OpenAI Tokenizer窶馬ot English words) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
