# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a community-maintained library to access OpenAI HTTP API's. The full API docs can be found here:
https://beta.openai.com/docs

## Installation üíª

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in the `Package.swift` file or by adding it directly within Xcode.

`.package(url: "https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift.git", from: "1.2.0")`

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `OpenAISwift` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'OpenAISwift'
```

### Manual

Copy the source files into your own project.

## Usage ü§©

Import the framework in your project:

`import OpenAISwift`

[Create an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it to your configuration:

`let openAI = OpenAISwift(authToken: "TOKEN")`

This framework supports Swift concurrency; each example below has both an async/await and completion handler variant.

### [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)

Predict completions for input text.

```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "Hello how are you") { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

This returns an `OpenAI` object containing the completions.

Other API parameters are also supported:

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendCompletion(
        with: "What's your favorite color?",
        model: .gpt3(.davinci), // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        maxTokens: 16,          // optional `Int?`
        temperature: 1          // optional `Double?`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

For a full list of supported models, see [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift/blob/main/Sources/OpenAISwift/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift). For more information on the models see the [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models).

### [Chat](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)

Get responses to chat conversations through ChatGPT (aka GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 (in beta).

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [
        ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Who won the world series in 2020?"),
        ChatMessage(role: .assistant, content: "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
        ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Where was it played?")
    ]
                
    let result = try await openAI.sendChat(with: chat)
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

All API parameters are supported, except streaming message content before it is completed:

```swift
do {
    let chat: [ChatMessage] = [...]

    let result = try await openAI.sendChat(
        with: chat,
        model: .chat(.chatgpt),         // optional `OpenAIModelType`
        user: nil,                      // optional `String?`
        temperature: 1,                 // optional `Double?`
        topProbabilityMass: 1,          // optional `Double?`
        choices: 1,                     // optional `Int?`
        stop: nil,                      // optional `[String]?`
        maxTokens: nil,                 // optional `Int?`
        presencePenalty: nil,           // optional `Double?`
        frequencyPenalty: nil,          // optional `Double?`
        logitBias: nil                 // optional `[Int: Double]?` (see inline documentation)
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Images (DALL¬∑E)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create)

Generate an image based on a prompt.

```swift
openAI.sendImages(with: "A 3d render of a rocket ship", numImages: 1, size: .size1024) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
    case .success(let success):
        print(success.data.first?.url ?? "")
    case .failure(let failure):
        print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

### [Edits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/edits)

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendEdits(

        input: "I am resigning!"
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Moderation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations)

Classifies text for moderation purposes (see OpenAI reference for more info).

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendModeration(
        with: "Some harmful text...",
        model: .moderation(.latest)     // optional `OpenAIModelType`
    )
    // use result
} catch {
    // ...
}
```

### [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)

Get a vector representation of a given input that can be easily consumed by machine learning models and algorithms.(see OpenAI reference for more info).

```swift
do {
    let result = try await openAI.sendEmbeddings(
        with: "The food was delicious and the waiter..."
    )
    // use result
