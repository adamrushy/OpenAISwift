# OpenAI API Client Library in Swift

This is a community-maintained library to access OpenAI HTTP API's. The full API docs can be found here:
https://beta.openai.com/docs

## Installation üíª

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)

You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in the `Package.swift` file or by adding it directly within Xcode.

`.package(url: "https://github.com/adamrushy/OpenAISwift.git", from: "1.2.0")`

### Manual

Copy the source files into your own project.

## Usage ü§©

Import the framework in your project:

`import OpenAISwift`

[Create an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it to your configuration:

let TOKEN = "sk-...... "

let openAI: OpenAISwift = OpenAISwift(config: OpenAISwift.Config.makeDefaultOpenAI(apiKey: "TOKEN"))


To follow [OpenAI requirements](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) 

>  Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

and basic industrial safety you should not call OpenAI API directly. 


## Contribute ‚ù§Ô∏è

I created this mainly for fun, we can add more endpoints and explore the library even further. Feel free to raise a PR to help grow the library.
